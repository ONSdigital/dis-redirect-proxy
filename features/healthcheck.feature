Feature: Healthcheck endpoint should inform the health of service

    Scenario: Returning a OK (200) status when health endpoint called
        Given redis is healthy
        And the redirect proxy is running
        And I wait 2 seconds for the healthcheck to be available
        When I GET "/health"
        Then the HTTP status code should be "200"
        And the response header "Content-Type" should be "application/json; charset=utf-8"
        And the health checks should have completed within 2 seconds
        And I should receive the following health JSON response:
